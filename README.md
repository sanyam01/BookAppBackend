Passport.js (Authentication)

1. Session management and sign out functionality


https://www.stackhawk.com/blog/react-broken-authentication-guide-examples-and-prevention/


Instead, you could store the session-id inside browser storage and use it via a custom React hook in whichever component or page of your application you need it. 


import { useEffect, useState } from "react"

export default function useSession({session_id}){

    const [sessionId,setSessionId]=useState()

    useEffect(()=>{
        if(session_id) setSessionId(session_id);
        else{
            if(localStorage.session_id) setSessionId(localStorage.session_id)
        }
    },[])

    useEffect(()=>{
        if(!localStorage.session_id) localStorage.setItem('session_id',sessionId)
    },[sessionId])

    return{
        sessionId
    }
}
